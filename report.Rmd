# Introduction

## Overview

In marketing, the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) indicates that $80 \%$ of profits come from $20 \%$ of customers, so it is essential for a company to identify its ideal customers and target them with more personalized products as well as marketing strategies. In this project, I first conduct a RFM (which stands for Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) analysis to categorize customers into different groups such as potential loyalist and customers at risk. Then I try to predict the total expenditures for each customer based on his/her age, income, education level, and etc. 

## Data Description and Preprocessing

The dataset can be accessed through the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis. There are 2240 observations/rows (2212 after some data cleaning procedures described later in this section) and 29 variables/columns in the data. The variables consist of customers' demographic information, the amount spent on wines, fruits, and meat during 2012-2014, the number of purchases made through the company's website, a catalog, and in stores, etc. More detailed descriptions of the variables can be found using the same link above.

In terms of data cleaning, there are 24 missing values in the income column. Also, the maximum value of income is 666666 which appears to be suspicious and might be a mistake, so I first remove all the observations which have missing values in the income column or have income values equal to 666666.After this step, the range of income is between 1730 and 162357, which is more reasonable than before. The age of each customer is calculated using $2014-\text{birth year of the customer}$. The maximum value of the computed age is 121, so I further remove all the observations with age values greater or equal to 100. After this procedure, the range of age is between 18 and 74. 

The variable "days_enrollment" is the number of days between the date of customer's enrollment with the company and 10/04/2014. The variable "num_childs" is the sum of the number of children and the number of teenagers in customer's household. The marital status of the customers is regrouped into two categories: previous martial status values such as "Absurd","Divorced","Single","Widow", and "YOLO" are categorized as "Alone"; "Married" values are renamed as "Together". The education of the customers is also regrouped into categories: values like "2n Cycle" and "Basic" are categorized as "Undergraduate", while values like "Graduation","Master", and "PhD" are categorized as "Postgraduate".



# RFM Analysis

Next, I conduct a RFM Analysis to segment customers based on how recently a customer made a purchase (recency), how often a customer makes a purchase (frequency), and how much money a customer has spent on purchases (monetary value). Table 1 lists the features we consider in this analysis. The variable "latest_visit_date" is computed via subtracting the values of the variable recency (which is the number of days since the customer's last purchase) from the date 10/04/2014. The values of the variables "latest_visit_date", "num_of_purchases", "expenditure" represent recency, frequency, and monetary value, respectively.

```{r, include=FALSE}
meta = data.frame(c("latest_visit_date: the date of the customer's latest visit", "num_of_purchases: the total number of purchases made in stores, through the company's website and using a catalogue", "expenditure:the total amount of money spent on fruits, meat, fish, sweet and gold")) %>% as_tibble()
```


```{r}
kable(meta, caption = 'List of variables used in RFM analysis', col.names = "Variable")
```

Each of the variables "latest_visit_date", "num_of_purchases", "expenditure" is assigned a numeric score (ranged from 1 to 5) referred as recency score, frequency score, and monetary score, accordingly. Customers with more recent purchases have higher recency scores. Similarly, customers with higher purchase frequency have higher frequency scores, and customers who spent larger amount of money have higher monetary scores. In all, higher scores usually represent better customers. The ideal customer would have a high score in each factor. Then I generate the RFM score by concatenating these three scores into a single value. For example, a customer with recency score "1", frequency score "2", and monetary score "3" will have a RFM score "123". 

The heat map below shows how the average monetary values vary for different recency and frequency scores. We can see that monetary value is concentrated in regions with high frequency scores. In other words, a large portion of the monetary value is concentrated around frequent shoppers.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(rfm)
data$num_of_purchases <- data$numcatalogpurchases+data$numstorepurchases+data$numwebpurchases

last_day <- as.Date("2014-10-04")
data$latest_visit_date = last_day-data$recency
data_rfm <- data %>% select(id, latest_visit_date, num_of_purchases, expenditure)
rfm_res = rfm_table_customer_2(data = data_rfm, customer_id = id, n_transactions = num_of_purchases, latest_visit_date = latest_visit_date, total_revenue = expenditure, analysis_date = last_day)

# label the various segments
segment_names <- c("Champions", "Loyal Customers", "Potential Loyalist",
  "New Customers", "Promising", "Need Attention", "About To Sleep",
  "At Risk", "Can't Lose Them", "Lost")

# set the upper and lower bounds for recency, frequency, and monetary for the above segments
recency_lower <- c(4, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1)
recency_upper <- c(5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2)
frequency_lower <- c(4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1)
frequency_upper <- c(5, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 5, 2)
monetary_lower <- c(4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1)
monetary_upper <- c(5, 5, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 5, 5, 2)

# use the segments and the bounds to categorize customers
segment <- rfm_segment(rfm_res,
                       segment_names,
                       recency_lower,
                       recency_upper,
                       frequency_lower, 
                       frequency_upper, 
                       monetary_lower,
                       monetary_upper)
```


Based on the RFM scores, I segment customers into different categories. These categories are not fixed but can be adjusted to satisfy different needs. As a reference, I use the categories defined in the R package "RFM". Table 2 lists the bounds for each category. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
meta = data.frame("Segment"=c("Champions", "Loyal Customers", "Potential Loyalist", "New Customers", "Promising", "Need Attention", "About to Sleep", "At Risk", "Can't Lose Them", "Hibernating", "Lost"), "R_score"=c("4-5", "2-5", "3-5", "4-5", "3-4", "2-3", "2-3", "<=2", "<=1", "1-2", "<=2"), "F_score"=c("4-5", "3-5", "1-3", "<=1", "<=1", "2-3", "<=2", "2-5", "4-5", "1-2", "<=2"), "M_score"=c("4-5", "3-5", "1-3", "<=1", "<=1", "2-3", "<=2", "2-5", "4-5", "1-2", "<=2")) %>% as_tibble()
```

```{r}
kable(meta, caption = 'Segment definition')
table(segment$segment)
```


By Table 3, we can see that top 5 segments (in terms of the percentage of customers in each segment) are "Loyal Customers" (customers who spend a good amount and bought frequently), "Potential Loyalist" (recent customers who spent a good amount and bought more than once), "At Risk" (customers who spent a good amount and purchased often but long time ago), "Champions" (customers with highest recency, frequency and monetary scores), "Lost" (customers with lowest recency, frequency and monetary scores).

```{r, include=FALSE}
res_seg = sort(round(table(segment$segment)/dim(data)[1]*100, 2), decreasing = TRUE)

top5cate = data.frame("Segment"=names(res_seg)[1:5], "Percentage (%)"=as.vector(res_seg[1:5])) %>% as_tibble()
```


```{r}
kable(top5cate, col.names = c("Segment", "Percentage (%)"), caption = "Top 5 segments in the data")
```



# Prediction of Expenditure

In addition to the RFM analysis, I try to predict the total amount of money spent on fruits, meat, fish, sweet and gold (the expenditure variable). Table 4 lists the variables we consider in this analysis.

```{r, include=FALSE}
meta = data.frame(c("education: the customer's education level, either 'Undergraduate' or 'Postgraduate'", "marital_status: the customer's marital status, either 'Alone' or 'Together'", "income: the customer's yearly household income", "age: the customer's age (from birth year to 2014)", "days_enrollment: the number of days between the date of customer's enrollment with the company and the date 10/04/2014", "num_childs: the number of children and teenagers in the customer's household (sum of the variables 'Kidhome' and 'Teenhome')", "expenditure:the total amount of money spent on fruits, meat, fish, sweet and gold")) %>% as_tibble()
```


```{r}
kable(meta, caption = 'List of variables used in prediction of expenditure', col.names = "Variable")
```


I first examine how customers' expenditure varies by their income, education level, marital status, and number of childs. 

![](figures/figure2.png)

By the figure above, we can see that customers' expenditure roughly increases as their income increases, but there are some outliers at high income values. The expenditure of customers with undergraduate degree seems to be slightly lower than that of customers with postgraduate degree. Also, customers without any child have much higher expenditure than those who have childs, but customers' expenditure does not differ much by their marital status.  


Instead of predicting the numeric values of the total expenditure, I convert the expenditure variable into a nominal variable with 5 levels: <=100, 100-500, 500-1000, 1000-1500, >1500. Next, I use different classification methods to predict expenditure levels based on the customers’ education level, marital status, income, age, days since enrollment with the company, and number of childs. The models considered are proportional odds (POR) model, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with k = 15, support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF), and naive bayes (NB). To compare these models, I evaluate the prediction accuracy of each model using 10-folds cross-validation method. Table 5 lists the overall prediction accuracy and the accuracy for predicting each expenditure level from different models.

```{r}
res <- readRDS(file = 'derived_data/res_models.rds')

kable(round(res*100, 2), caption = 'Model prediction accuracy (%) comparison')
```


By Table 5, we can see that the overall accuracy for each model is relatively low, only about $55 \% \sim 65 \%$. The random forests (RF) model and the proportional odds (POR) model appear to have the highest overall accuracy. All the models seem to have good prediction accuracy on the first level ('<=100') of the expenditure variable but perform poorly on the rest levels. 



# Conclusion and Future Direction

In the RFM Analysis, I segment customers into different categories based on recency, frequency, and monetary values. The top 5 segments (in terms of the percentage of customers in each segment) are “Loyal Customers” (customers who spend a good amount and bought frequently), “Potential Loyalist” (recent customers who spent a good amount and bought more than once), “At Risk” (customers who spent a good amount and purchased often but long time ago), “Champions” (customers with highest recency, frequency and monetary scores), “Lost” (customers with lowest recency, frequency and monetary scores). The company can use the customer segmentation results to design more personalized marketing plans. For example, the company can deliver more promotion offers to customers categorized as "Potential Loyalist", which may convert these customers into "Loyal Customers" or "Champions" (i.e., more ideal customers for the company). 

However, in this analysis, I categorize customers only by their total expenditure and total number of purchases, but we can follow similar procedures to group customers according to the amount of money spent and the number of purchases made on each of the categories: fruits, meat, fish, sweet, gold, etc., which may help us to identify the ideal customers for specific types of products. Also, here I assign the recency, frequency, and monetary scores ranged from 1 to 5 using the "RFM" R package. Nevertheless, the range of the scores are not fixed, and we can calculate the scores via other methods. For example, we can assign scores based on different quantiles of the recency, frequency, and monetary values. In addition, we may consider using clustering methods like K-Means and Gaussian Mixture models to group customers and compare how customers in different groups vary from each other.

In the Prediction of Expenditure, I convert the numeric variable expenditure into a nominal variable with 5 levels and try to predict the expenditure levels based on the customers’ education level, marital status, income, age, days since enrollment with the company, and number of childs. The overall prediction accuracy for different models are low. To improve the accuracy, we may consider include more information about the customers as the covariates. We may also predict customers' expenditure on different products instead of predicting the total expenditure.
